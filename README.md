# weather_prediction
The dataset contains the date, location, and weather features for a given day, and the problem of interest is predicting whether it will rain tomorrow, which is recorded in the RainTomorrow variable.

Objectives:
1) Data preprocessing and feature extraction 
2) Train and test data split.
3) Learn an SVM with a linear kernel and an SVM with a radial kernel for your training set.  Optimize the cost hyperparameter (both models) and the radial kernel hyperparameter Î³ (radial model) using 5-fold cross validation.
4) Learn a Random Forest model and Gradient Boosted Decision Tree for training set and optimize the hyperparameters of models. Plot the feature importance measures for both Random Forestand Gradient Boosted Decision Tree models.
5) Report accuracy of above models and comment on the degree of model overfitting with ROC plot.
